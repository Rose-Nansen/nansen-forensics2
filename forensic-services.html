  <h5 >Mobile Forensics</h5>
<p class="write-upL">The term mobile forensics refers to the process of acquisition or extraction of digital data stored on a mobile device. A mobile device maybe a mobile phone, an iPad, Samsung Galaxy tablet or other similar device. Specialised mobile forensic tools and techniqus are used to acquire as much data as possible from the device, often including deleted data.
  <br />
  <br /> All procedures and methods follow forensic principles which means the data is obtained in a form that is admissible in court proceedings.
  <br />
  <br />
  We aim to provide you with the data you require within 48 hours of receipt of the device.
</p>
    </div>
<div class="col-md-6 pt-2">
<h5>Network Forensics</h5>
<p class="write-upR">Network forensics invloves the examination of networks and the data that travels across them. Investigations requiring network forensic analysis include incidents such as the inappropriate or unlawful use of work systems committed by an employee, malicious conduct arising from an insider threat (again an employee or contractor), or a security incident committed by an intruder external to the organisation. Your system has been 'hacked'. 
  <br />
  <br />
  These investigations involve piecing together what has occurred and delivering a timeline of what, how, when, where and by whom the incident was committed. All cases are managed in accordance with forensic principles.  
  <br />
  <br />
  If you are concerned about being a victim of a network security incident, ask us about <strong>Chain-fs</strong>, a blockchain based critical file and log store developed by our team. A world first technology that is patent pending.

<div class="col-md-6 mt-5 pt-3">
<h5>Computer or Cyber Forensics</h5>
<p class="write-upL">The term computer forensics refers to the analysis of a computer's hard drive. This involves making a forensic copy of the computer's hard drive, allowing the analyst to examine it in depth without fear of altering the original. The analyst will review files, images, documents, web history, emails, recover deleted data where possible, and examine a range of other relevant data. 
  <br />
  <br />
  All analysis is conducted objectively, with all relevant information, data or evidence presented to our clients. 
  A comprehensive report is then written about the work we've undertaken which is suitable for presentation to a court if required. 
 <br />
 <br />
 Our clients may prefer to conduct their own analysis or review particular files such as emails, documents or other data. To assist, we provide our clients with the required data in a format that simplifies this process, whilst remaining available to answer questions or provide support whenever needed.
