  <h5 id="Mobilef" class="s-headings" >Mobile Forensics</h5>
<p class="write-upL">The term mobile forensics refers to the process of acquisition or extraction of digital data stored on a mobile device. A mobile device maybe a mobile phone, an iPad, Samsung Galaxy tablet or other similar device. Specialised mobile forensic tools and techniqus are used to acquire as much data as possible from the device, often including deleted data.
  <br />
  <br /> All procedures and methods follow forensic principles which means the data is obtained in a form that is admissible in court proceedings.
  <br />
  <br />
  We aim to provide you with the data you require within 48 hours of receipt of the device.
</p>
    </div>
<div class="col-md-6 mt-3 pt-2">
<h5 id="Networkf" class="s-headings">Network Forensics</h5>
<p class="write-upR">Network forensics involves the examination of networks and the data that travels across them. Investigations requiring network forensic analysis include incidents such as the inappropriate or unlawful use of work systems committed by an employee, malicious conduct arising from an insider threat (again an employee or contractor), or a security incident committed by an intruder external to the organisation (your system has been 'hacked'). 
  <br />
  <br />
  These investigations involve piecing together what has occurred, delivering a timeline of what, how, when, where and by whom the incident was committed. All cases are managed in accordance with forensic principles.  
  <br />
  <br />
  If you are concerned about being a victim of a security breach, ask us about <strong>Chain-fs</strong>, a blockchain based critical file and log store developed by our team. A world first technology that is patent pending.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6 mt-4 pt-2">
<h5 id="computerf" class="s-headings">Computer or Cyber Forensics</h5>
<p class="write-upL">The term computer forensics refers to the analysis of a computer's hard drive. This involves making a forensic copy of the computer's hard drive, allowing the analyst to examine it in depth without fear of altering the original. The analyst will review files, images, documents, web history, emails, recover deleted data where possible, and examine a range of other data relevant to your case. 
  <br />
  <br />
  All analysis is conducted objectively, and all information, data or evidence presented to our clients. 
  A comprehensive report is then written about the work we've undertaken which is suitable for presentation to a court if required. 
 <br />
 <br />
 Our clients may prefer to conduct their own analysis or review of particular files such as emails, documents or other data. To assist, we can provide our clients with a case file in a format that simplifies this process, whilst remaining available to answer questions or provide support whenever needed. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6 mt-3 pt-3 bg-light">
<h5 id="dronef" class="s-headings">Drone Forensics</h5>
<p class="write-upR">Drones or Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV's) are used for a wide range of services and often hold large amounts of sensitive data within the hardware of the drone or on removeable media held by the drone. From evidence collection through to large complex commercial operations, there are many circumstances where data stored on a drone is required for forensic analysis. 
  Evidence obtained usually consists of flight data, dates and times and all media caputured by the drone including images and videos. 
  <br/>
  <br />
  There is a wide variation of drones on the market, often differing in their use of proprietary software. If you require assistance in capturing critical data from a drone, please contact us to discuss how we can assist you. 
<br />
<br />
Like all the work we do, a comprehensive report suitable for presentation in court is prepared for our clients, with an accompanying statement as required.

<div class="col-md-6 mt-3 pt-4 bg-light">
<h5 id="blockchainf" class="s-headings">Blockchain Forensics</h5>
<p class="write-upL">Blockchain forensics is typically associated with investigations into digital money, otherwise known as cryptocurency. But what is the blockchain and why have we allocated a separate write up to crypto?
  <br />
  <br />
  A Blockchain is a digital record of transactions stored as blocks which are linked together to form a chain. Cryptography is used to interconnect the blocks, and the entire chain is distributed amongst a network of computers. No one authority controls the chain, unlike traditional systems where a central authority holds all the power. For this reason the blockchain is said to be a decentralised, peer to peer network.
<br />
  <br />
  Information on the blockchain cannot be deleted or modified, so the data is said to be immutable. There are many exciting benefits to blockchain technology which is why some people say it will transform the future. 
  
<br />
  <br />
   The blockchain can be used for a wide range of applications, from supporting cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, to tracking chain of supply, and managing the sale of goods through its associated technology called Smart Contracts.
   Our blockchain forensic services extends to any service where blockchain is involved, and may include attempts to disrupt, corrupt, interfer or control the chain, otherwise known as a 51% attack. 
  <br />
  <br />
   In addition, our team have the skills and experience to examine blockchain and smart contract code, to identify potential vulnerabilities in your blockchain build. All our team are Certified Blockchain Security Professionals (CBSP).
     <br />
  <br />
  As a company involved in Blockchain Research and Development, we believe the provision of blockchain forensic services beyond cryptocurrency is critical.

</div>
        
<div class="col-md-6 mt-3 pt-3">
<h5 id="cryptof" class="s-headings">Cryptocurrency Forensics</h5>
<p class="write-upR">Cryptocurrency forensics involves examining cryptocurrency transactions for criminal, civil and regulatory cases. The belief that cryptocurrencies offer total anonimity is false, in fact, cryptocurrency is easier to trace than cash. 
  <br />
  <br />
  That is not to say all cases involving crypto analysis can be solved. Those involved in illegal activities, not limited to drugs, fraud, scams, money laundering and others, go to great lengths to obsfucate transactions, using a variety of known methods. 
Yet despite this, the development of specialised tools and methods have allowed analysts and investigators to solve many cases by tracing cryptocurrency transactions. 
 <br />
  <br />
  For a long time cryptocurrency was associated with illegal activity, but today people all around the world trade in crypto for legitimate purposes. There are currently more than 68 million crypto currency wallets in existence globally. 
<br />
  <br />
  Who may need our services?
  <br />
  <ul class="s-list"> 
    <li>Government departments responsible for ensuring Exchanges, businesses and individuals comply with Australian Laws and Regulations.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Companies and businesses who are victims of a ransomware attack, fraud or corruption, been lured by fake ponzi schemes, lost tokens or had cryptocurrency stolen.  </li>
    <br />
    Individuals who have been the victim of a theft or scam, losing their valuable cryptocurrency in the process.
     <br /> 
     <br />
    In any case where fraud, money laundering, theft or uncovering hidden funds is required. This is not an exhaustive list.

<div class="col-md-6 mt-3 pb-5 pt-3">
<h5 id="nftf" class="s-headings">NFT Forensics</h5>
<p class="write-upL">What is a Non Fungible Token? 
   <br />
A token is something that represents another asset, whether it be physical or virtual.
For example, a gift voucher could be a token, so can computer source code, cryptocurrency or even a physical security device, such as a smart card. These  are all legitimate examples of tokens. 
The term fungible refers to assets that are interchangeable. For example, two $50.00 notes hold the same value as one $100.00 note and there is no change in value. 
<br />
<br />
A Non-fungible Token differs because they are unique digital assets, not interchangeable and their value may fluctuate, such as the value of a piece of artwork.   
Examples of non-fungible tokens include unique images, graphics, digital games, music, digital art and videos.
<br />
  <br />
  NFTs are created on the blockchain so a record verifying the ownership of the unique asset and all associated transactions is maintained. 
 NFTs are most commonly created on the Ethereum blockchain and can purchased and sold using Ethereum's cryptocurrency, Ether. 
<br />
  <br />
 How big is the market?
  <br />
 According to the NonFungible Market Report Q1, 2022, a total volume of USD $16,456,945,150 was traded in the first quarter. With $23 billion traded in 2021, it appears 2022 will be an enormous year for NFT trade.
<br />
  <br />
  The benefits of NFTs to artists, musicians and others, is they open pathways to earning royalties from ongoing sales, and the authenticity of the artists work can be verified, which also greatly benefits the buyer. 
  The risks associated with NFTs are the prevalence of frauds and scams, and their use for other illegal activities such as money laundering.
 <br />
  <br />
  Investigating NFT cases involve similar methods to tracing cryptocurrency with some differences. If you fear you have been caught up in a scam, impacted by fraud or theft, then contact us to discuss your case.
