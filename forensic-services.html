<h5>Mobile Forensics</h5>
<p>The term mobile forensics refers to the process of acquisition or extraction of digital data stored on a mobile device. A mobile device maybe a mobile phone, an iPad, Samsung Galaxy tablet or other similar device. Specialised mobile forensic tools and techniqus are used to acquire as much data as possible from the device, often including deleted data.
  <br />
  <br /> All procedures and methods follow forensic principles which means the data is obtained in a form that is admissible in court proceedings.
  <br />
  <br />
  We aim to provide you with the data you require within 48 hours of receipt of the device.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
